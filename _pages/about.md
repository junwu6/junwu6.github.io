Dr. Jun Wu is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.msu.edu/about/departments/cse) at the [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/) (MSU). Before joining MSU, he received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. He has a broad research interest in trustworthy machine learning, transfer learning/domain adaptation, and graph learning, with applications in agriculture, bioinformatics, e-commerce, and legal analytics. He has multiple publications at major peer-reviewed conferences and journals (e.g., ICML, AISTATS, NeurIPS, KDD, AAAI, JAIR, TKDE, etc.). He has also served as a (senior) program committee member in ML/AI conferences (e.g., ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, AISTATS, KDD, AAAI, IJCAI, etc.). His work has been recognized by the [2025 AAAI New Faculty Highlights](https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-25/new-faculty-highlights-program/) and the [2025 SIGKDD Dissertation Award Honorable Mention](https://kdd2025.kdd.org/).

**To prospective students:** I am seeking self-motivated students to join my research group. If you are interested in working with me, please drop me an email with your CV, transcript, and a brief overview of your research experience. Find more information [here](https://junwu6.github.io/recruitment/).

**Research**

I am interested in exploring data heterogeneity and enforcing model trustworthiness in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data mining. Currently, my research includes the following topics:
* Heterogeneous machine learning, e.g., transfer learning/domain adaptation, out-of-distribution generalization, etc.
* Trustworthy machine learning, e.g., adversarial robustness, uncetainty quantification, etc.
* Graph machine learning, e.g., graphon theory, etc.
