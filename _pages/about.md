I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.msu.edu/about/departments/cse) at the Michigan State University (MSU). Before joining MSU, I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I have a broad research interest in trustworthy machine learning, transfer learning/domain adaptation, and graph learning, with applications in agriculture, bioinformatics, e-commerce, and legal analytics.

**To prospective students:** I am seeking self-motivated students to join my research group in Spring 2024 or Fall 2024. If you are interested in working with me, please email your CV, transcript, and a brief overview of your research experience.
