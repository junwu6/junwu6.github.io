I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.msu.edu/about/departments/cse) at the [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/) (MSU). Before joining MSU, I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I have a broad research interest in trustworthy machine learning, transfer learning/domain adaptation, and graph learning, with applications in agriculture, bioinformatics, e-commerce, and legal analytics.

**To prospective students:** I am seeking self-motivated students to join my research group in Fall 2025. If you are interested in working with me, please drop me an email with your CV, transcript, and a brief overview of your research experience. Find more information [here](https://junwu6.github.io/recruitment/).

**Research**

I am particularly interested in exploring data heterogeneity and ensuring model trustworthiness in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data mining. Currently, my research includes, but is not limited to, the following topics:
* Heterogeneous machine learning, e.g., transfer learning, domain adaptation, out-of-distribution generalization, etc.
* Trustworthy machine learning, e.g., adversarial robustness, privacy, fairness, transparency, etc.
* Graph learning, e.g., network of networks, heterogeneous information network, graphon modeling, etc.
* AI for scientific discovery, e.g., plant phenotyping, scRNA-seq integration, privacy policy analysis, etc.
