Thanks for your interest. I will recruit two fully funded Graduate Research Assistants (GRAs) in Spring 2025 or Fall 2025. If you are interested in joining my team, please apply to the MSU CSE [graduate program](https://at3.cse.msu.edu/Students/Future_Grad/HowToApply.php) and mention my name in your application statement. Students with CS, math, and EE backgrounds are particularly encouraged to apply!

Here are several optional research projects in my team.

* Out-of-distribution generalization. The goal is to learn a domain-agnostic prediction function from training domains such that the learned function performs well on new unseen domains. There are two key research challenges: learning a good foundation model from training domains and identifying the generalization bounds.

* Fairness and Robustness of LLMs. It seeks to determine whether black-box large language models (LLMs) consistently deliver fair and robust results to a diverse range of users and customers. 

* Transparency of transfer learning. It explains what knowledge is being transferred in the transfer learning process, e.g., what essential knowledge of pre-trained LLMs can be leveraged for user-specific downstream tasks, and how to efficiently find a pre-trained LLM from thousands of candidates in HuggingFace. Another relevant problem is the uncertainty quantification of the transfer learning models, which determines how confident the models are in their predictions.

* Fundamental trade-off between prediction accuracy and trustworthy properties under distribution shifts. This aims to theoretically understand how trustworthy properties (e.g., privacy, fairness, etc.) affect the transfer learning performance.
